Papyri
======

Welcome to Papyri narrative docs. 

This show that papyri can support narrative docs as well as API docs, 
though for the time being API docs are better supported. 

If you find issues feel free to `Open and issue on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/papyri/>`__.

If you are working only on API docs, you can use ``papyri gen <conffile.toml> --no-api``, to skip the API generation
part. Though be aware that some of the cross linking features will not work.
