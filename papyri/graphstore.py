    Class abstraction over the filesystem to store documents in a graph-like
    structure

    We do not want to use the server or alike as most of our users will use REPL
    or IDE and performance is not our goal as we are likely going to access
    nodes infrequently.

    Plus we are not that much interested in the graph structure (yet), than the
    local neighborhood.

    We also have some specificities around document versions, which I'm not
    clear yet as to how to deal with, as well as dangling edges.

    Each document is stored with an ~4 item keys:

     - package it belongs to
     - version
     - kind of document
     - name of document

    Each document will also have references to others, with types; those are our
    edges.

    When we get a document, we do want to get as well all most recent the
    documents that reference it and why that is to say the coming edges.

    When we put a document, we ask for all the documents this references; and
    should update the edges accordingly.

    I don't really want to store a global edge document â€“ though it might seem
    the most reasonable; sqlite ? So I was thinking of storing a companion
    document with all the back references; but maybe sqlite is a better
    approach.

    One more question is about the dangling documents? Like document we have references to,
    but do not exist yet, and a bunch of other stuff.
