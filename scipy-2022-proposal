Papyri: Better Documentation for the Scientific Ecosystem in Jupyter

> Abstract:*	

Python has multiple stories for documentation: docstrings, narrative
documentation built via Sphinx and hosted online, and Dynamic Tutorials by
downloading notebooks. However, none of these offer a complete documentation
experience. Via a reusable framework we call Papyri, we want to offer a
state-of-the-art documentation experience to end-users. We want to show our
progress over the past 9 month after being funded by the Chan Zuckerberg
initiative. The current proof of concept allows library authors to publish a
semantic Intermediate Representation Documentation format (IRD). On users’
machines, tools can leverage IRD to provide access to the full richness of the
Python Ecosystem documentation. This project represents the key for the
development, quality, ease of use, and discoverability in a growing Python
ecosystem. Additionally, this framework will open the door to several other
valuable features, such as allowing docstrings to be written in the widely-used
markdown format, better configuration of end-user appearance and preferences,
translations and domain-specific alternatives, indexing, and others.



> Keywords
> Type a list of keywords (also known as key phrases or key terms), one per line to characterize your submission. You should specify at least three keywords.


> 
> Keywords:*	

Jupyter, Documentation, markdown, RST.

> Other Information and Files
> Short Summary.* A brief description which will appear in the online program and give attendees a basic sense of your talk or poster. This should be around 100 words or less

In this talk we will demo and discuss the work that is being done on Papyri, a
new framework to provide rich documentation  in Jupyter and Terminal IPython
with plots, crosslink, equations. We will describe how libraries can opt-in to
this new framework, what are the trade-off of using it, the current
capabilities and the one planed with current funding, as well as where this
could go in th future.

> Type of Submission.* Please indicate whether you would like to be considered for a talk slot or poster slot. Please note that talks that are not accepted are automatically considered for a poster slot.
